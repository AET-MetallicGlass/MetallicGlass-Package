Folder 5_simulation_with_noise shows the procedures and results for Multislice AET simulations with Poisson noise, which was added to each projection according to the electron dose. The doses were set to 1.7×104 e/Å2 (match with experiment) and 5.6×104 e/Å2 per projection. The reconstruction, tracing and classification, and RMSD calculation procedures and results were summarized in Folders Multislice_dose_1p7e4_per_proj and Multislice_dose_1p7e4_per_proj.
