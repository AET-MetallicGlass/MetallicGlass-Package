Folder '5_simulation_with_noise' contains the procedures and results for Multislice AET simulations with Poisson noise, which was added to each projection based on the electron dose. The doses were set to 1.7e4 e/Å^2 (matching the experimental conditions) and 5.6e4 e/Å^2 per projection. The procedures and results for reconstruction, tracing, classification, and RMSD calculation are summarized in the folders 'Multislice_dose_1p7e4_per_proj' and 'Multislice_dose_5p6e4_per_proj'.
