The folders '1_recon', '2_tracing', and '3_posref' contain the procedures and results for Multislice AET simulations based on experimental projections. '1_recon' shows the reconstruction process, '2_tracing' covers tracing and classification, and '3_posref' details the position refinement steps. The folder '4_results' presents the root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the final atom positions and the ground truth.

Folder '5_simulation_with_noise' contains the procedures and results for Multislice AET simulations with Poisson noise, which was added to each projection based on the electron dose. The doses were set to 1.7e4 e/Å^2 (matching the experimental conditions) and 5.6e4 e/Å^2 per projection. The procedures and results for reconstruction, tracing, classification, and RMSD calculation are summarized in the folders 'Multislice_dose_1p7e4_per_proj' and 'Multislice_dose_5p6e4_per_proj'.
